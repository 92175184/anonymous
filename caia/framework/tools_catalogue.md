# Appendix: CAIA Evaluation Toolkit

This appendix provides a high-level overview of the tool capabilities available to models during tool-enabled evaluation. The toolkit is designed to provide comprehensive coverage of information sources relevant to cryptocurrency and blockchain analysis tasks. For readers unfamiliar with cryptocurrency terminology, we provide analogies to traditional financial research tools where applicable.

| Category | Tool Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Market Data | `Price Feed` | Lets the model see how a value changed over time, much like a basic line chart. |
| Market Data | `Ranking Query` | Highlights which assets are currently attracting the most attention, similar to a simple leaderboard. |
| Market Data | `Positioning Analysis` | Summarizes how traders are leaning (more optimistic or more defensive) using broad signals. |
| Market Data | `Volatility Alerts` | Flags recent market shake-ups so the model knows when volatility has spiked. |
| Technical Analysis | `Indicator Analysis` | Generates plain momentum/trend cues (e.g., "upward drift" vs. "cooling off") without requiring financial jargon. |
| Discovery/Search | `Web Search` | Finds public references related to a question and returns brief summaries. |
| Discovery/Search | `URL Fetching` | Pulls the text of an external article so the model can paraphrase or cite it directly. |
| Discovery/Search | `Trend Detection` | Points out topics or assets that are suddenly being discussed more than usual. |
| Social Sentiment | `Twitter Search` | Surfaces popular posts to show what people are currently talking about. |
| Social Sentiment | `Social Stream` | Provides curated discussions from recognizable commentators in one place. |
| DeFi Metrics | `Protocol Metrics` | Offers a broad sense of whether a project or application is seeing more or less engagement. |
| DeFi Metrics | `Revenue Analysis` | Gives a lightweight indication of whether people are paying to use a service. |
| DeFi Metrics | `Network Activity` | Summarizes overall activity on a larger network so relative interest can be compared. |
| DeFi Metrics | `Exchange Summary` | Shows where trading or usage is concentrated across platforms. |
| DeFi Metrics | `Exchange Overview` | Rolls multiple signals into a "big picture" summary for quick orientation. |
| On-Chain Data | `Supply Query` | Answers "how much of this asset exists" in plain terms. |
| On-Chain Data | `Data Query` | Reads publicly available ledger data so the model can confirm basic facts. |
| On-Chain Data | `Time Conversion` | Converts a calendar time into the ledger's internal reference, making it easier to find past events. |
| On-Chain Data | `Balance Query` | Reports what a particular account currently holds. |
| On-Chain Data | `Transaction Query` | Shows what happened in a specific ledger entry. |
| On-Chain Data | `Block Query` | Gives the headline information for a single ledger page (time, order, etc.). |
| Token Analytics | `Release Schedule` | Lists upcoming moments when more of an asset becomes available, similar to a basic release calendar. |
| Execution | `Code Execution` | A small workspace for quick arithmetic or comparisons when needed. |
